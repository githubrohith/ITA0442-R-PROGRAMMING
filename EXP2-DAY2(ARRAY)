2.Â Write a R program to combine three arrays so that the first row of the first
array is followed by the first row of the second array and then first row of the third
array.


PROGRAMME:
num1 = rbind(rep("A",3), rep("B",3), rep("C",3))
print("num1")
print(num1)
num2 = rbind(rep("P",3), rep("Q",3), rep("R",3))
print("num2")
print(num2)
num3 = rbind(rep("X",3), rep("Y",3), rep("Z",3))
print("num3")
print(num3)
a = matrix(t(cbind(num1,num2,num3)),ncol=3, byrow=T)
print("Combine three arrays, taking one row from each one by one:")
print(a)
